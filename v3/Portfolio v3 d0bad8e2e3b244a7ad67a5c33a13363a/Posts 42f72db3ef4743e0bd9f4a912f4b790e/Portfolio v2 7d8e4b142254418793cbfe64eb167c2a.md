[Kalen Wallin | Portfolio.v2](https://v2.kalenwallin.com/)

[Portfolio.v2](https://v2.kalenwallin.com/) is my 2nd portfolio website. This site showcases my growth as a web developer and is a playground for me to test new ideas. It contains the same content as here, so no need to reread anything! The design was inspired by Netflix.

# Design

The hero image was taken in Iceland during my study abroad trip in 2022. 

The card cover images were from [Portfolio.v1](Portfolio%20v1%202aea33d2e18d4042a6b6527d8c672d83.md) which were designed in Adobe Express and Figma.

The logo/favicon was designed in Adobe Express as a png, then traced in Figma for SVG. Sadly Adobe Express doesn't support export to SVG. 

Adobe has a converter tool, but it's hit-or-miss. So I usually just use Figma and trace the outline with a pen tool. Then export the frame as an SVG.

# Development Details

## Framework

I developed it in Django, which is a full-stack web framework that uses python in the backend and HTML, CSS, JavaScript in the frontend.

## Hosting & Deployment

Portfolio.v2's code lives on [GitHub](https://github.com/kalenwallin/portfolio.v2) and is hosted by Vercel which can be found here:
