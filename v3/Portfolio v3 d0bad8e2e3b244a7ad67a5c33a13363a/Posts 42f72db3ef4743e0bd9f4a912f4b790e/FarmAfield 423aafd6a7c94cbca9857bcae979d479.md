I played a key role within a team of four talented software engineers, dedicated to maintaining and enhancing the FarmAfield website with innovative features and a user-friendly interface.

# Notable Features

## Dark Mode

My favorite feature to implement was a customizable theme feature, allowing users to effortlessly toggle between light and dark modes within their account settings. The website intelligently adapts to users’ device/browser preferences, with the option to override these settings for ultimate personalization.

## Email Preferences

I contributed to an efficient email management system, enabling users to add a secondary email and adjust their marketing email preferences within their account settings. Utilizing AJAX POST requests, the user experience is optimized by eliminating the need for page refreshes.

## Solar Landing Page

Expanding FarmAfield’s offerings, I designed an inviting landing page and an interactive “See if solar is right for me” form for the Solar site, connecting farmers with investors to fund solar panel installations on their land. View the site below:

## Cookie Policy

I created a cookie policy and a cookie consent banner:

## Notifications

I created the notifications drop-down menu and page. Users can mark the notifications as read to dismiss them without refreshing the page by making use of AJAX. All notifications can be found in the notifications page. 

# Development Details

My team and I followed Agile development methodology and utilized an array of tools, including Django, Foundation, GitHub, PostgreSQL, Redis Server, Yarn, Webpack, and Poetry. The team’s technical expertise spanned across Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript languages. Rigorous testing, including Selenium, Unit, and Integration tests, ensured the website’s reliability and performance. Workflow management was streamlined through the use of Jira.

# Personal Experience

I liked working at FarmAfield. I was treated well by my boss and my colleagues. They listened to my ideas and let me implement most of them.

    May - August
    
    I started my internship at FarmAfield during the summer of 2021. This was the year following the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, so naturally I worked remotely. They had an office in Lincoln, Nebraska at the Nebraska Innovation Campus.
