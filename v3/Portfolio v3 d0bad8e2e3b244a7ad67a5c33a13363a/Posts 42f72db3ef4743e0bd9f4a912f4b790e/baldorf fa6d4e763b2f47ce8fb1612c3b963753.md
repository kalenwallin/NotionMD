I worked on baldorf for my senior project in a course an the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) called Senior Design (CSCE 486 & 487). It was a 2-semester long course that involved working with business or organization to gather and implement requirements.

# Overview of Process

1. Assigned to [baldorf](https://mysticrhoads.org/baldorf/) project and [Mystic Rhoads Productions](https://mysticrhoads.org/) company
2. Met with company sponsor to gather initial requirements.
3. Met as a team to translate those requirements into an Agile roadmap with Milestones, Epics, Stories, and Issues.
4. Continued meeting with the team throughout the past year to implement those features detailed in the roadmap. As well as continually meeting with the sponsor to share work, collect feedback, and gather updated requirements.
