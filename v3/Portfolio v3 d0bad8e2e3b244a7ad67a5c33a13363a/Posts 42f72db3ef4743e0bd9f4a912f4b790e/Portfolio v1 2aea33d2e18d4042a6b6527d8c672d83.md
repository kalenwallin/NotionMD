[Kalen Wallin | Portfolio.v1](https://v1.kalenwallin.com/)

[Portfolio.v1](https://v1.kalenwallin.com/) was the first portfolio website I created. 

# Features

- Category Navigation Bar
    
    Experiences are split into categories. Each category shows a different page of experiences.
    
- Experience Cards
    
    Experiences are divided into cards. Each card has a:
    
    - Cover image: 1364x768 resolution
    - Title
    - Short Description
    
    Cards are displayed as just the cover image. When hovered over, a container holding Title and Short Description appears using vanilla CSS animations.
    
    Clicking on the card causes an Experience Modal to appear. 
    
- Experience Modals
    
    Once you click on an Experience Card, its modal appears. This modal contains
    
    - Title of the Experience
    - Content
    
    The content typically is a description of the experience that contains text, images, or interactive content like video games, PDFs, or iframes.
    
- Dark Mode
    
    Has a toggle button in the navigation bar to toggle dark mode on or off. Powered using JavaScript to add a CSS class to the body element.
    

# Graphic Design

Graphic design is a big passion for me, right up there next to web development. 

I designed most of the cover images myself using Adobe Express and Figma. Some covers, like baldorf and Minieval, were already designed and I just put them into a format and resolution that worked well for my site.

The navbar icons come from [Open Icon](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/oi/).

# Development

## Framework

I created it using Blazor Web Assembly (WASM) which is apart of Microsoftâ€™s .NET framework. The programming languages include C#, JavaScript, HTML, & CSS.

## Deployment & Hosting

The source code is available on GitHub:

[https://github.com/kalenwallin/portfolio.v1](https://github.com/kalenwallin/portfolio.v1)

This code is built and compiled to a new branch gh-pages using GitHub Actions. Cloudflare pages detects when a change is made to gh-pages and automatically deploys this code production. Kalen has his DNS configured to serve this website at the following domains:

- [kalenwallin.com](http://kalenwallin.com)
- [www.kalenwallin.com](http://www.kalenwallin.com)
- [v1.kalenwallin.com](http://v1.kalenwallin.com)

The subdomain v1 is actually hosted by GitHub Pages. In fact, Kalen used to serve his apex and www domains using GitHub Pages. 

However, he's found Cloudflare to offer higher performance than GitHub Pages, which is why he made the switch. He still offers the v1 subdomain to make performance comparisons from time to time. 

He particularly likes to watch how fast they can deploy from a code change. GitHub Pages usually wins this race, but they have a competitive advantage given that the code is hosted on their server.

# The Problem

## Scaling

Everything in this site is hard coded. That means if I want to make a change to the content, I have to edit the source code and push the changes. 

This is fine in a simple app like a portfolio. But as I share more and more experiences, the pain of making rewriting code on the site becomes overwhelming. That is why I designed a new portfolio called Portfolio.v2, which I hope will solve the problem

## Partly Fixed in Portfolio.v2

Using the popular full stack framework Django, I created a new portfolio using a data-driven mindset. I only wrote code for an element or component once, then reused that component every time I added a new project. 

This saves a lot of time and space in the code repository. It also is the way most website these days work. Think about a social site like Twitter. If they had to manually edit the source code each time someone tweeted, then their source code would be trillions of lines of code (not to mentioned this would be impossible to execute).

## Fully Fixed in Portfolio.v3

I now use a content management system called Notion to write blog posts for my stories. These are rendered into html on my [Portfolio.v3 website](https://v3.kalenwallin.com). Since I like working on my old portfolios still, I incorporate the new content in the form of iframes. That way I only have to write content once, and it displays the same throughout all my sites.
