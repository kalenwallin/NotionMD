# Purpose of Portfolio.v3

You're probably wondering why I have 3 portfolios. Let me explain:

The first portfolio was to show off my work and the second portfolio was to use my new web dev skills I learned at my internship and apply it to a personal project. I had a new idea for a portfolio and decided that I would use my Django skills for that purpose.

This third portfolio, I'm using as more of a rendering tool for my Notion pages that I can serve on portfolio.v1 and v2. See any of the website cards/pages on v1 and v2 as examples:

[Kalen Wallin | Portfolio.v2](https://v2.kalenwallin.com/#row-2-container)

By having one source for all my experiences, I only have to write one article and write updates to that single article. 

Before v3, I was writing for both v1 and v2 on separate sources. Meaning that I had to update 2 different sources for the same material.

This got too cumbersome. Also, I was writing the articles in raw HTML, which is not a pleasant writing/editing experience.

With Notion, I get a beautiful writing/editing experience and the reader gets a beautiful and consistent reading experience, no matter which portfolio they are on.

# Graphic Design

## Logo/Favicon

I designed the logo/favicon, which was inspired by the Next.js logo, in Figma. You can view the progression of the logo in the source file:

I was stuck for a day deciding which color to use. I shared it with several friends and colleagues to gather feedback and ultimately decided on Indigo. I chose it for several reasons

because it’s not that common of a color on the web and makes my portfolio standout more. It also goes well with some of my AI images.

1. It represents power and dignity which convers integrity and deep sincerity. [[source]](https://www.empower-yourself-with-color-psychology.com/color-indigo.html#:~:text=Indigo%20is%20a%20deep%20midnight,conveys%20integrity%20and%20deep%20sincerity.)
2. I don’t see it a lot on the web, so it’ll make my portfolio stand out more.
3. It goes well with my AI images.

## Cover Images

Some cover images I create using generative AI which I detail in this post:

Others I created using Figma. The rest are images from Unsplash.

# Development

## Framework

This site is built on top of the Next.js Notion Starter Kit by Travis Fischer.

The framework is Next.js, which is a full-stack web framework that adds server capabilities to React.js, which is a frontend JavaScript library. This project uses Typescript, JSX, HTML, and CSS.
